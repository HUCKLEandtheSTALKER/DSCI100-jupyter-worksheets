# Heart Disease Predictive model
A collaborative project for a data science course where our team of four applied a k-nearest-neighbors classification algorithm to a dataset of heart disease patients from four hospitals, to create a model that predicts heart disease based on various factors. In testing, our model was able to predict heart disease with 77 percent accuracy.
